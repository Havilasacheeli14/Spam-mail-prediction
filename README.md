Spam Mail Prediction

This project focuses on building a **Spam Mail Prediction system** using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to automatically classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on their content.

📌 Project Overview

Email spam is one of the most common problems in digital communication. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to detect spam emails efficiently by training a model on labeled email data.

The notebook included in this repository walks through:

* Data preprocessing
* Feature extraction
* Model training
* Evaluation of results

🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

⚙️ Workflow

1. Data Collection – Load a dataset containing spam and non-spam emails
2. Data Cleaning – Remove unnecessary characters and preprocess text
3. Feature Extraction – Convert text data into numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF)
4. Model Training – Train a machine learning classifier
5. Model Evaluation – Measure accuracy and performance
6. Prediction – Test the model with new email inputs

 📊 Model Used
Machine Learning classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression)

🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:

   bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
  
3. Open the notebook:

   bash
